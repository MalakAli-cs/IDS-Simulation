# Intrusion Detection System Simulation

#### This project is a simulation of IDS for Embadded System. this project is developed to simulate and explain how Intrusion Detection Systems detect attacks or suspicious activities on the network.

## Requirements:
  * ESP32
  * Breadboard
  * Rotary Encoder
  * RTC (Real Time Clock)
  * RGB LED
  * 5V Active Piezo Buzzer
  * SD Card + Micro SD Card Module
  * OLED 182*64 pixel
### C++ Programming Language
### Libraries:
  *	WiFi.h
  *	WebServer.h
  *	Wire.h
  * Adafruit_GFX.h
  *	Adafruit_SSD1306.h
  *	HTTPClient.h
  *	Preferences.h
## Installation / Setup:
  * install IDS.rar
  * Open IDS project on Arduino IDE
  * Install required libraries
  * Upload the code
## Usage:
#### When you finish uploaing the code and starting it, the RGB LED will be green then it will change to Yellow and Red colors with an alarm from buzzer related to system statuse.

## Features:
  * Easy
  * Used for educational purpose
  * Real time alerting
